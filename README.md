### Description

My way of printing the content of MSHFlexGrid Control.

Supports different sizes of rows and columns, individual cell formatting, fonts, font size, style, colors and alignments. Enough spaces for header and footer, to insert header footer just use PRINT method of VB. Vertical and horizontal space between columns and rows. Each cell can be printed with angular or rounded corners. Gridlines can be enabled disabled. Elimination of rows and column is possible. It also has boarder with width, color and style. Easy pagination it prints only given number of rows, give RowsFrom to RowsTo. It also has vertical and horizontal rulers which helps in placing text exactly in printed media.
